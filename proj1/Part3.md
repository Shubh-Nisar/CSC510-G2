### Setup and Installation

All code is installed and run on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **Step 1:** We clone the repository to our local machine using the following git command.

      git clone https://github.com/PvPatel-1001/Recipe_Recommender.git

- **Step 2:** We install the node modules and the package dependencies of the client and the server. We open two separate terminals and type the following commands.

  > In the Server Terminal

      cd Code
      cd backend
      npm install

  > In the Client Terminal

      cd Code
      cd frontend
      npm install

- **Step 3:** We now move on to starting the development server on our local machine.

  > In the Server Terminal

      node index.js

  > In the Client Terminal

      npm start
